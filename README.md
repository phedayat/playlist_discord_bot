# Simple Playlist Bot

Discord bot which listens for a particular channel where users share links to songs on Spotify. From those URLs, it adds the songs to a collaborative playlist.

The playlist it's writing to is set as an environment variable. The playlist ID must be set for the bot to work correctly; it can be obtained via the Spotify API.
